# Teamwork (Experimental React App)

- `yarn` to install dependencies from root.
- `yarn start` to run app. Then open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

## Build, Publish & Deploy

Each build will be targeted for a specific public url or deploy path. The env variable `PUBLIC_URL` can be defined in the build process.

```
PUBLIC_URL=/teamwork yarn webpack -p
```

Then we can publish the dist folder using the `dx app` cli. 

```
yarn dx app publish
```

Register the version on the Registry

```
yarn dx register
```

And finally test locally:

```
yarn dx app serve --app dxn:app:dxos.org/teamwork --path /teamwork
```
